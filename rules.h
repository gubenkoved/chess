    // ---------------------------
    // This function was written because many of figures can be described in general manner.
    // e.g.
    //  - bishop can guard in 4 diagonal lines (forward-right, forward-left, backward-right, backward-left) to
    //     the end of board, and guard line interrupted by obstacle (figure)
    //  - rock have simular situation, but have anothe line definition
    //  - queen is actually bishop + rock
    //  - pawn, yes even pawn have obly 2 guard lines (forward-left and forward-right) but it len limited by one
    //
    // RETURNS: Function returns positions on some line before obstacle (figure) but inclusive it
    //
    // NOTE: valid xMult and yMult values in set {-1, 0, +1}!!!
    //
    // yMult = 1 means what line has forward direction, -1 - backward
    // xMult = 1 means what line has direction which x are increasing
